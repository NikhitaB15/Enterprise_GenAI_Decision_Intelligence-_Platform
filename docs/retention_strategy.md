# Enterprise Retention Strategy: Tiered Intervention Model

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the standard operating procedures for customer retention. Our goal is to reduce churn by identifying "At-Risk" customers early and applying targeted interventions based on customer lifetime value (CLV) and risk score.

## 2. Risk Tiers & Actions

### 🔴 High Risk (Churn Score > 0.8)
*   **Intervention**: Immediate Outreach.
*   **Action**: Assign Senior Account Manager for a "Health Check" call.
*   **Offer**: Up to 20% discount for 6 months or 1 month free service extension.
*   **Timeline**: Within 24 hours of risk detection.

### 🟡 Medium Risk (Churn Score 0.5 - 0.8)
*   **Intervention**: Automated Value Reinforcement.
*   **Action**: Trigger personalized email campaign highlighting unused features.
*   **Offer**: Free training session or "Value Audit."
*   **Timeline**: Within 3 business days.

### 🟢 Low Risk (Churn Score < 0.5)
*   **Intervention**: Proactive Engagement.
*   **Action**: Quarterly newsletter and feature updates.

## 3. Intervention Policies
- **Discount Allocation**: Discounts must not exceed 25% of the annual contract value.
- **Support Scaling**: Customers with >5 open tickets in 30 days are automatically escalated to the Support Excellence Team regardless of churn score.
- **Competitor Matching**: We do not price-match competitors directly; focus must remain on unique value propositions (Security, Integration, Support).

## 4. Documentation Requirements
All retention efforts must be logged in the CRM with the tag `#Retention2024`.
